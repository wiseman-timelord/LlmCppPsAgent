# LlmCppPsAgent

### STATUS: Development.
The batches for this program may only run on Windows 10 due to the different PowerShell launch commands required for various OS versions, that microsoft have bizarly chosen to use, and may cause endless launch loop on other systems. I attempted to schedule it for fixing, but my internet access was ended due to financial constraints, additionally my internet was mysteriously blocked in the last 3 weeks of being able to get into debt for internet/gpt4 access to, produce and progress, my programs. My programming projects are on hold, and I received no assistance during my inability to work because of a back injury. Despite seeking support, the NHS and my workplace (EVRi) have not been helpful, resulting in my termination for unsound reasons. Universal credit requires me to work without a doctor's note. In short, I'm currently unable to work, and you'll have to wait for multi-OS support, the crowd-funder was not there for no reason, I genuinely needed help to continue.
1) libraries are configured, downloaded, setup, through installer batch, thereabouts, research and use, of additional libraries, to enhance various aspects of the program. 
2) Model Interaction - Expanded to 3 config files for keys
3) upgraded interface - now with, mapped and color, content.

### OUTSTANDING:
1) Syntax Menu - select syntax format from some shortlist of popular formats, this then set to settings file for next run. formats such as, "### Instruction" (used by Daydreamer v3) or "[INST] <<SYS>>" (used by Llama2) or "{system_message} User:" (used by Falcon), will review this later. 
2) Already has temp implemented in title of engine, when interaction done, must try and re-integrate so people can see updated information about temps, as I feel this is important, additionally would ideally involve freezing of areas of text on the display. Researching into shell enhancements.

### DESCRIPTION:
The "LlmCppBot" is a sophisticated PowerShell application that integrates GGUF-based models into a dual-window interface on contemporary Windows platforms. Specifically, the, "window_1" and "window_2", scripts are launched independently via batch, with "window_1" dedicated to the engine's operations and "window_2" offering a seamless chat interface. The program leverages ".ENV" file for environment configurations, ensuring adaptability and ease of setup. Additionally, a standalone batch "configuration" is incorporated, streamlining the process of hardware configuration and facilitating the download of essential libraries. This design ensures a robust and user-friendly experience for those interacting with the GGUF models.

### USAGE:
1) Run "Configuration.bat", ensure you know your hardware specs, and then choose your binaries accordingly, the batch will take care of the rest (providing you dont have abnormal system settings).   
2) Ensure you have inserted a GGUF format of model into the ".\models" folder, [this one](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGUF/blob/main/llama-2-7b-chat.Q4_0.gguf) will do, just the "example_llm_name.gguf" file itself, thats 1 file, don't confuse it with 2+.
3) Run "LlmCppBot.bat", the program is then running, however, if there is no ".\.ENV" (first run), then it will generate one, and you should make a quick edit upon it, and then run "LlmCppBot.bat" again.

### COMPATIBILITY:
* Hardware Support - Avx1, Avx2, Avx 512, Non-Avx, ClBlast, CuBlase 11, CuBlas 12, OpenBlas. Use, [HWinfo](https://www.guru3d.com/download/hwinfo64-download) and [GPUz](https://www.guru3d.com/download/gpu-z-2-1/), to figure out your tech.
* Model Support - Currently being developed for "[INST] <<SYS>>" syntax, such as Llama-2 models: [Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-7b-Chat-GGUF), [Llama-2-13B-chat-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-13B-chat-GGUF), [Llama-2-70B-chat-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-70B-chat-GGUF), though later this will be expanded through syntax selection menu.

### DEVELOPMENT
- Using "InputText.dll" in conjunction with "PowershellRM" in Rainmeter to create an interactive interface for language models is quite feasible.
